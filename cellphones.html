<h1> Cell phone puzzle! </h1>
<p id="prompt">
Suppose that there is a building with 100 floors. You are given 2 identical cellphones. The most interesting property of the cellphones is that every cellphone has its own "threshold" floor. Let's call that floor N. What this means is that the cellphone will not break when dropped from any floor below floor N, but the cellphone will definitely break from any floor above floor N, including floor N itself.
<br>
For example, if the property of the cellphones is that N equals 15, those cellphones will always break on any floor higher than or equal to the 15th floor, but those cellphones will never break on any floor below floor 15. The same holds true for the other cellphone since they are identical.
<br>
These are very strong cellphones, because they can be dropped multiple times without breaking as long as they are dropped from floors below their "threshold" floor, floor N. But once an cellphone is dropped from a floor above its threshold floor it will break and may not be used again.
<br>
Your task is to figure out the threshold floor N by dropping the two cellphones off of the building. What is the minimum number of drops necessary to accomplish this goal?
